    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a doctoral researcher at the Chair of Digital Signal Processing and Circuit Technology at TU Chemnitz, having joined after graduating from TU Dresden. My research focuses on applying computer vision and machine learning technologies to various industrial and social domains, including rehabilitation, active assisted living, autonomous driving, and railway safety. I actively participate in teaching activities, instructing courses on basic and advanced computer vision, 3D vision, Python for data scientists, and deep learning for computer vision. My Ph.D. thesis explores real-time human detection, pose estimation, and activity recognition using top-view omnidirectional imaging with fisheye cameras.
